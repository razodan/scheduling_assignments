# scheduling_assignments
by Daniel Razo
Uses integer programming via PuLP to schedule teaching assignments optimally.

Information must be parsed in a particular way. Details to be added later.
This was originally done as project 1 for CS 6150 Advanced Algorithms at Utah Valley University during Fall 2022.
In view of academic honesty, the original project code is not included. Instead, this code is code that the CS department (during my employment) requested me to work on, to make scheduling teaching (and TA'ing) assignment much easier for the department.
